### Task List for Integrating Vocabulary into Ancillary Projects

---

### 0. Document Project Structure and Technology Stack

1. **Describe the Project Structure**:
   - **Stack and Frameworks**: Document the technology stack used (e.g., Django, Docker, CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries).
   - **File Structure**: Outline the main file structure, noting key directories like `static`, `templates`, `models`, and any frontend assets.
   - **Dependencies**: List any CSS/JavaScript libraries already in use, such as Bootstrap or jQuery, to check for compatibility with Vocabulary.
   - **Existing Components**: Summarize the UI components currently in use and note any style guides or design patterns.

2. **Describe the Project Structure for Vocabulary**:
   - **Stack and Frameworks**: Note any frameworks or tools used within `vocabulary`, such as CSS preprocessors (Sass/LESS) or JavaScript frameworks.
   - **File Structure**: Outline the `vocabulary` directory structure (e.g., folders for `css`, `js`, and `components`).
   - **Component Overview**: List the main components provided by Vocabulary, like buttons, forms, and tables, with notes on intended use and style guidelines.

3. **Document Integration Points**:
   - Identify where the project and `vocabulary` will connect, such as the main CSS file and base HTML template.
   - Note any areas where existing dependencies or custom styles may overlap with Vocabulary to facilitate troubleshooting.

### 1. Set Up Environment and Dependencies

- **Organize Vocabulary Files**:
   - Download `vocabulary` and move its contents into the project, placing the `/src` folder as `static/vocabulary` (or another designated directory) to keep styles and scripts accessible within the project. If Vocabulary is already integrated, review the files to ensure setup is correct, including CSS and JavaScript dependencies.

- **Link Vocabulary CSS and JavaScript**:
   - In the project’s main CSS file (e.g., `style.css`), import Vocabulary styles to ensure consistent layering.
   - In the project’s base HTML template, add the Vocabulary JavaScript file before the closing `</body>` tag to enable required behaviors.
   - Verify that the integrated CSS and JS don’t clash with existing files.

- **Verify Setup**:
   - Run the project to confirm Vocabulary styles and scripts are correctly integrated and check for conflicts or styling issues.

### 2. Audit Existing Components in the Project and Catalog Vocabulary Components

1. **List All UI Components**:
   - Go through the project and document each UI element, including:
      - **Buttons** (primary, secondary, icons, etc.)
      - **Forms** (input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons)
      - **Modals** (pop-up windows or overlays)
      - **Tables** (data tables or lists)
      - **Headers and Footers** (site navigation, links, etc.)
   - Note where each component appears and any style variations (e.g., different colors).

2. **Screenshot or Document Component Behavior**:
   - Take screenshots of each component in its various states (e.g., default, hover, active).
   - Note interactive behaviors, such as hover effects or form validation.

3. **Catalog Vocabulary Components**:
   - Review `vocabulary/src` and list all components, styles, and utilities available.
   - Note component names, functions, and configuration options (e.g., button styles or colors).
   - Identify which Vocabulary components can directly replace existing project components and where customizations might be required.

---

### 3. Map and Compare Components Between the Project and Vocabulary

- **Create a Comparison Table**:
   - Build a table listing each project component alongside its closest matching component in Vocabulary.
   - Include columns for component name, description, and any visual or functional differences.

- **Classify Each Component**:
   - Mark each project component as:
      - **Direct Match**: Can be replaced directly by a Vocabulary component.
      - **Needs Customization**: Requires adjustments to the Vocabulary component.
      - **No Match**: Has no equivalent in Vocabulary.

- **Document and Plan for Missing Components**:
   - For components marked as "No Match," decide if they should be implemented in the project or added upstream in Vocabulary for reuse.
   - Note any customizations needed to guide development for components marked as "Needs Customization."

---

### 4. Prototype Core Page Integration

- Select a core page in the project (e.g., homepage or search page).
- Replace one or two components with Vocabulary equivalents (e.g., a button or form element).
- Test functionality and styling to confirm that Vocabulary components integrate smoothly with existing content.

---

### 5. Refactor Pages Component-by-Component

- Go page by page through the project, replacing each component in the following order:
   - Buttons
   - Forms
   - Navigation elements (headers, footers)
   - Tables and data displays
   - Modals and alerts
- Ensure that each component replacement preserves the original functionality of the page.

---

### 6. Remove Redundant CSS and JavaScript in the Project

- After component replacements, identify any redundant CSS or JavaScript specific to old project styles.
- Remove or refactor these styles, prioritizing Vocabulary’s CSS for consistency.
- Confirm that each page appears and functions correctly without any custom styles that may interfere with Vocabulary.

---

### 7. Conduct Accessibility Tests on Each Page

- Run accessibility tests on pages with integrated Vocabulary components using tools like Lighthouse or axe.
- Address any issues to ensure Vocabulary’s accessibility features are applied, and confirm the project meets WCAG standards.

---

### 8. Test Component Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Check each updated page for responsiveness on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to catch any cross-browser styling issues with Vocabulary components.

---

### 9. Update Documentation

- Update the project’s README with Vocabulary setup instructions, noting any specific steps for using new components.
- Document any customizations or additions made to Vocabulary specifically for the project to maintain consistency.

---

### 10. Prepare for Deployment

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and there are no errors in the development environment.
- Verify that build or deployment scripts (like `docker-compose.yml`) are updated to include Vocabulary’s resources.
- Conduct a final round of testing to confirm functionality across the entire application.
